	// SearchHash is a stable hash of the grep query parameters used to
	// produce this result set (e.g. pattern, root, path, filters). It allows
	// UIs to de-duplicate or uniquely identify rows across searches.
	SearchHash string

	// RangeKey is an optional, human-readable range identifier derived from
	// the first snippet window (e.g. "12-24"). It is intended as a secondary
